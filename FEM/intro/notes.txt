Primitive values are int, float, string, boolean , null ,undefined
Non Primitive values are Arrays ,function, Promise,object Primitive values are passed by value 
Non Primitive values are passed by reference

PASS BY VALUE:
The variable gets a seperate space in memory

Eg: 

var x = 5
var y = x //The value of y and x is 5

x = 10

console.log(x) //The value of x is 10
console.log(y) //The value of y is 5

So y is allocated a seperate memory space 

PASS BY REFERENCE:
In pass by reference the variables share a memory space i.e The variables point to the same memory space

//OBJECTS USAGE OF DOTS

var person = []

person.name = "Mrs.White"

var who = person.name;

person[0] = " I was not in the billiards room " 

person.0 //Throw an error Because it is a syntax error. It is not a string

We can use the brackets [] when we can use the DOTS

We can use the dot (.) when the value is string literal / valid variable name
