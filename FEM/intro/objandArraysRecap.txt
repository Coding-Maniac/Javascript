What is an object?

QUESTIONS
1.What is the difference between dot and bracket notation?
2.How do you add a property with a key that contains special characters?
3.How do you add a property whose key and value are stored in different variables?
4.How do we loop through objects to access the values? --not answered
5.When can you only use dot notation and not bracket?                                
6.When can you only use brackets and not dot?
7.How do you add a property with a key that is stored in a variable?
8.How do you access an object that is inside another object?
9.How do you create an object that is nested inside another object?
//ES6 Destructuring
10.How do you destructure variable declaration and how does it work?
11.How do you destructure object declaration and how does it work and does order of declaration matter?

ANSWERS:
1.The dot notation is used to save characters and can be used at only specific places such as strings whereas the brackets can be used for anything
var person = {}
person.name = "Sanjay"
person.0 //This throws us an syntax error
person[0] = "Kapilesh" //This is correct
2.Use Bracket Notations
3.  var key = "Well I am a key";
    var value = "I am a value";
    var person = {};
    person[key] = value
4. loop? I am not sure till now
5. We need to use dot notation when we need to key passed to be parsed as a string
Eg: 
    var person = {};
    person.firstName= "Sanjay"; //In this firstName is converted to a string
    person[secondName] = "Kapilesh"; //In this secondName is treated as a variable and it results in an error as secondName is undefined
6. We need to use bracket in case of using weird expressions and numbers
Eg: 
    person.0 = "Meh" //This will throw an error;
    person[0] = "I work"
    person["^&"] = "The weird expression is in quotes" //The variable is ^& which is not common and must be used with strings and inside a bracket
7. Use the bracket notation. Check answer number 3 for example

//ES6 Destructuring

10. Eg: 
    const [first, second] = [true, false]
    let[first, second] = [true, false]
    This works based on the order.
    The first element on the left array is matched to the first element on the right array
11 Eg:
    const {first, second} = {first:0, second:1}
    let{a, b} = {b:0, a:1}

    Destructuring of object doesnot depend on order
    Destructuring of object depends on the same variable name
    In the above example a is 1 and b is 0, first is 0 and second is 1.
